## Description

This project is a great example for C socket programming. by using it you can play Dots and Boxes from differant clients. All you need is a server to run the server code on. Feel free to use the code to understand C socket programming.

## How to Build

First, run the following to build the project:

    make

Then you can run the server by using:

    ./server <port_number>

Where \<port_number\> should be replaced by the port you want your server to run on.

To run the client, you can use:

    ./client <port_number> <optional: username>

Where \<port_number\> is the same as server's port number, and \<username\> is an optional field for your username in game.
